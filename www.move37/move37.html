              <h2>move37 team</h2>
              <p>Watching the documentary was the inspiration for me to lunge headfirst into the world of computer science. The first thing I did was figure out what majors and what skills I needed to help be part of this incredible field. My brother and I shared this common goal 
              and promised to one day manifest those ambitions. My brother Kevin Stull is an applied mathematician seeking an accelerated masters, at Colorado University of Boulder. I Michael Stull am a double major student athlete seeking a degree in Computer Science and Mathematics
              from Westmont College. My roomate Connor Lynch is a Buisness and Economics major with unbelievable drive and work ethic. I believe our greatest strength is Human Capital. Westmont College lies in the heart of Monteceto, Santa Barbara and there is not place like it in the
              world. CEO's, Proffesional Athletes, Movie Stars, and college students are in constant connection in this small vibrant community. The Proffesors are Incredible Assets and trustworthy. So I believe that what we lack in financial capital, we make up for completly
              in Human Capital and Resources. As a team of past Student Athletes, Connor Lynch(Men's Soccer Westmont), Michael Stull(Men's Soccer Westmont), Kevin Stull(17ft PoleVaulter), we have incredible collaboration skills as well as work ethic.
