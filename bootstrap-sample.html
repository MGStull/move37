          Here is a poetic interpretation of AlphaGo's 37th move against Lee Sedol. A poem of an AI from an AI(ChatGPT): In the ancient art of Go,
                  Moves are made with stealth and flow,
                  A dance of stones on lines so straight,
                  To conquer territory, win the state.

                  The world watched in awe that day,
                  As AlphaGo made its 37th play,
                  A move so deep, so pure and true,
                  Its beauty left the champion feeling blue.

                  With grace and ease, the stone was placed,
                  In a spot that left the master faced,
                  With a challenge, he'd never seen,
                  From a machine's mind so serene.

                  It spoke of future moves, untold,
                  And left the champion feeling old,
                  For the future of the game was clear,
                  With machines like AlphaGo, so near.

                  So here's to move 37, a work of art,
                  In the game of Go, it played its part,
                  And forever will be remembered,
                  As a turning point, in the art of surrender.
