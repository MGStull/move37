          Here is a poetic interpretation of AlphaGo's definitive 37th move against Lee Sedol cementing its win. A poem of an AI from an AI(ChatGPT): <br>
                  In the ancient art of Go, <br>
                  Moves are made with stealth and flow, <br>
                  A dance of stones on lines so straight, <br>
                  To conquer territory, win the state. <br>
                  <br>
                  The world watched in awe that day, <br>
                  As AlphaGo made its 37th play, <br>
                  A move so deep, so pure and true, <br>
                  Its beauty left the champion feeling blue. <br>
                  <br>
                  With grace and ease, the stone was placed, <br>
                  In a spot that left the master faced, <br>
                  With a challenge, he'd never seen, <br> 
                  From a machine's mind so serene. <br>
                  <br>
                  It spoke of future moves, untold, <br>
                  And left the champion feeling old, <br> 
                  For the future of the game was clear, <br> 
                  With machines like AlphaGo, so near. <br> 
                  <br>
                  So here's to move 37, a work of art, <br>
                  In the game of Go, it played its part, <br>
                  And forever will be remembered, <br> 
                  As a turning point, in the art of surrender. <br>
